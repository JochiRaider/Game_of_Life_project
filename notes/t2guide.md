SOC analysts play a critical role in protecting an organization's information assets. Refer to NIST Special Publication 800-61 Rev. 2 for more about the role of a SOC.</p><p><strong>Understanding Security Operations</strong></p><p>SOC typically has three main functions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: SOC analysts monitor an organization's networks and systems for signs of malicious activity. Reference: NIST Special Publication 800-92.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detection</strong>: SOC analysts investigate suspicious activity and determine if it is a security incident. Reference: NIST Special Publication 800-83.</p></li><li><p><strong>Response</strong>: SOC analysts respond to security incidents by taking steps to contain the incident and mitigate the damage. Reference: NIST Special Publication 800-61 Rev. 2.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Security Incident Response</strong></p><p>A security incident is an event that may have a negative impact on an organization's information assets. The goal of security incident response is to minimize the impact of a security incident. This involves steps to contain the incident, mitigate the damage, and restore normal operations. Refer to the SANS Institute's Incident Handler's Handbook for more about incident response.</p><p><strong>Security Vulnerability Management</strong></p><p>A security vulnerability is a weakness in an organization's information systems that could be exploited by an attacker. The goal of security vulnerability management is to identify, assess, and mitigate security vulnerabilities. Refer to the NIST Special Publication 800-40 Rev. 3 for details on vulnerability management.</p><p><strong>Security Compliance</strong></p><p>Security compliance is the process of ensuring that an organization's information security practices meet the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards. The goal of security compliance is to protect an organization from legal liability and financial losses. Refer to the ISO/IEC 27001 standard for more about information security management and compliance.</p><p><strong>Security Tools and Technologies</strong></p><p>A variety of security tools and technologies can be used to help SOC analysts monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents. These tools include:</p><ul><li><p>SIEM tools: SIEM tools collect and analyze security logs from across an organization's networks and systems. For more details, consult vendor-specific documentation for tools like Splunk, LogRhythm, etc.</p></li><li><p>Intrusion detection systems (IDS): IDS tools monitor networks for suspicious activity. Reference: NIST Special Publication 800-94.</p></li><li><p>Intrusion prevention systems (IPS): IPS tools take action to block suspicious activity. Reference: NIST Special Publication 800-94.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This study guide has provided an overview of the topics that are important for tier 2 SOC analysts. By understanding these topics, you can be well on your way to a successful career in security operations.</p><p><strong>Onboarding Tips</strong></p><p>Here are some tips for onboarding a new tier 2 SOC analyst:</p><ul><li>Clearly define the analyst's role and responsibilities.</li><li>Provide necessary training and resources.</li><li>Set achievable goals and expectations.</li><li>Be patient and supportive, allowing for a learning curve.</li></ul><p>By following these tips, you can help ensure that your new tier 2 SOC analyst is successful in their role. Consider formal training programs and certifications like CompTIA's Security+, CySA+, or EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) for comprehensive preparation.</p></div>
