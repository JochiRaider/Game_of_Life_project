Pseudo-Code:

REQUIREMENTS
//Here, you will list any libraries, tools, or technologies needed for your code. This provides a quick overview of the external dependencies your code will have.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
// This section describes the problem you're trying to solve and the desired output of your code. If applicable, you can provide examples of inputs and the expected output. This helps to clarify the purpose of your code.


DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
// List the data structures and algorithms to be used

MODULES AND CLASSES
// If you're using an object-oriented programming language, you can define the classes your code will use here. For procedural languages, you can define the modules you'll use instead.

//For each function in your code, you should specify its name, the arguments it takes, and the type of value it returns. You should also describe what the function does, including any operations it performs, control structures it uses (like loops or conditionals), and how it handles errors. Make sure to also describe how the function modifies any data structures or variables.
FUNCTION FunctionName1(arguments) -> return_type
    // Declare variables/constants

    // Perform operations
    // Use control structures (loops, conditionals) and error handling

    // Return value or modify data structures
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION FunctionName2(arguments) -> return_type
    // Declare variables/constants

    // Perform operations
    // Use control structures (loops, conditionals) and error handling

    // Return value or modify data structures
ENDFUNCTION

//This is where you'll call the required functions and handle user input and output. Again, you should describe any operations, control structures, and error handling in this function. This is usually the function that ties all your other functions together.
FUNCTION Main()
    // Declare variables/constants

    // Call the required functions and classes
    // Handle user input and output

    // Use control structures (loops, conditionals) and error handling
ENDFUNCTION

TESTING
// Finally, describe any unit tests or example scenarios you'll use to test your code. This helps to ensure that your code works as expected and is crucial for maintaining code quality.
